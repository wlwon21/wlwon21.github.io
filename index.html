          <h2>The Future of Streaming Services</h2>
          <p class="description">The success of streaming services is no secret, certainly not with them being so ingrained
            into our lives. Due to the vastly different licenses streaming services have, one needs to subscribe to multiple streaming services.
            Yetm this is becoming increasingly difficult as these services increase their prices. These prices beg the question,
            <a href="https://medium.com/@jiwon21/the-future-of-streaming-services-what-does-it-hold-for-you-5625cf5f6c13">what does the future hold for the streaming landscape?</a>.

          <h2>TV in 10</h2>
          <p class="description">
            This week, we <a href ="https://on.soundcloud.com/7gsTp">explore</a> the successes and failures of Marvel TV shows. What works for Marvel TV? And what doesn’t? 
            Through the examination of Loki, Moonknight, and Secret Invasion, we seek to answer those questions and ultimately find the golden formula for making Marvel TV shows.

          <h2>Making Robin's Wheel | Origami </h2>
          <p class="description">
            Do you like origami? I used to when I was a kid. I was a child that would start folding paper all the time if there was a sheet of paper (any really) in front of me. 
            I will be making Robin's Wheel with paper. Not too hard, <a href="https://youtu.be/YvR6fEo5n28">watch me</a> making this wheel, and maybe we can make this wheel together.
